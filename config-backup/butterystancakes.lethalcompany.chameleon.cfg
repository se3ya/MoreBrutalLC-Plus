[Rendering]

## The currently orbited planet is visible on the ship's external security camera while in space, as it used to be in v38.
## You should disable this if you encounter lighting issues on the ship.

# Default value: true
PlanetPreview = false

## Light passes and spreads through the foliage for nicer visuals. Performance impact is negligible.
