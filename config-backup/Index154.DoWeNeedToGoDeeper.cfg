[1. Entrance control activation]

## Default percentage chance for the entrance control systems to activate on any given day. Will make it so by default everyone can only enter through the main entrance and leave through the fire exits. The other modes will override this behavior
# Setting type: Int32
# Default value: 20
# Acceptable value range: From 0 to 100
Global activation chance = 2

## Comma-separated list of moons with custom entrance control activation chances. Example: 'Titan:0,Vow:25,March:90,Dine:5,Gratar:100'. This will override the global chance for the selected moons. Modded moons should also work
# Setting type: String
# Default value: 
Custom activation chances per moon = Collateral:0,Vow:0,Experimentation:0,Integrity:0,Brutality:0

[2. Dynamic mode]

## Default percentage chance for dynamic mode to activate on any given day where the entrance control systems have already been activated. Will make it so everyone can enter using any door. Each player can then only exit through the type of door they did not enter through. If you teleport into the facility then you can use any door to leave. This mode will take priority over corruption mode
# Setting type: Int32
# Default value: 50
# Acceptable value range: From 0 to 100
Global dynamic mode chance = 25

## Comma-separated list of moons with custom dynamic mode chances. Example: 'Titan:0,Vow:25,March:90,Dine:5,Gratar:100'. Modded moons should also work
# Setting type: String

Custom dynamic mode chances per moon = 

[3. Corruption mode]

# Setting type: Int32
# Default value: 10
# Acceptable value range: From 0 to 100
Global corruption chance = 5

## Comma-separated list of moons with custom corruption chances. Example: 'Titan:0,Vow:25,March:90,Dine:5,Gratar:100'. This will override the global chance for the selected moons. Modded moons should also work
# Setting type: String
# Default value: 
Custom corruption chances per moon =
