## When should high speeds (exceeding 50u/s, vanilla's "speed limit") explode the jetpack?
## "Off" will only explode when you crash into something solid.
## "OnlyTooHigh" will explode if you are flying too fast, while you are also *extremely* high above the terrain.
## "Always" will explode any time you are flying too fast. (Most similar to vanilla's behavior)
# Setting type: MidAirExplosions
# Default value: OnlyTooHigh
# Acceptable values: OnlyTooHigh, Always, Off
MidAirExplosions = Always

## When dropping the jetpack, instead of immediately coming to a stop, you will maintain the same direction and speed.
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: false
TransferMomentum = true
