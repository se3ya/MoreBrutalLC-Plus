# Default value: 0.5
# Acceptable value range: From 0 to 1
Snare Flea Fixed Damage = 0.5

## At what threshold of health should the snare flea drops off the player if it's using the 'Second Chance' mode (vanilla value in singleplayer is 15 HP).

## By default, changes the angle and position of the player cam to look up at players from below their chin (which is slightly more realistic, lets you see more of their surroundings, and is funny). The angle and position are configurable below, so theoretically you can put it wherever you want.
