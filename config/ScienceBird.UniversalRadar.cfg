[!Config Management]

## This check box acts like a button which will only activate once then go back to being unchecked: after starting a game, all unused config data will be cleared. This means config entries associated with moons that are no longer installed or entries for modes which are no longer active for a given moon (e.g. if you switch a moon's mode from Manual to Automatic, the manual options will still be leftover in the file).
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: false
Clear Orphaned Entries On Next Join = false

## Used for internal config tracking, please ignore.
# Setting type: String
# Default value: -1.-1.-1
Config Version = 1.1.0

[!General]

## When a moon has non-mesh terrain, it will be converted in order to generate the contour map. This will mean a long initial load on maps with non-mesh terrain (this includes most of Wesley's moons), but after the first time, it will store the generated mesh for the rest of the session. If this ends up taking way too long or even causing timeouts/crashes, you can disable it here (though any moons with non-mesh terrain will no longer have contour maps).
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: true
Convert Terrains To Mesh = true

## Overrides all individual configs and will never attempt to create radar images for non-terrain objects.
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: false
Master Disable Radar Objects = false

## How big objects need to be to render as an object on the radar screen (if that config is enabled on the moon). Make this bigger to display less small objects.
# Setting type: Single
# Default value: 90
# Acceptable value range: From 50 to 1000
Radar Object Display Threshold = 90

## Generates a special mesh for water objects on vanilla and modded moons.
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: true

[Automatic Settings]

## Spacing between lines in automatically generated contour maps.

# Setting type: Single
# Default value: 0.9
# Acceptable value range: From 0,1 to 1
Maximum Opacity = 0.9

## Logs all contour map values (notably the minimum and maximum height) upon generating on a moon. Use this if you want to know the normally calculated values before manually customizing them yourself (or for other debugging purposes).
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: false
Log Automatic Values = false

[Camera]

## When outside, the region of space captured by the camera needs to be extended for the 3D contours generated by this mod to be captured. Increasing this means more objects/scenery above and below a player will be picked up on the radar screen (set this to 0 for vanilla clipping distance).
# Setting type: Single
# Default value: 20
# Acceptable value range: From 0 to 150
Increased Render Distance = 20
