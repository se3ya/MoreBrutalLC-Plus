[Base Properties]

## How much health to regenerate every cycle. I recommend keeping this at 1 and adjusting the cycle duration to change the speed.
# Setting type: Int32
# Default value: 1
# Acceptable value range: From 1 to 100
Regen Amount Per Cycle = 1

## Time in seconds between each cycle. Once a cycle happens, the amount of health above will be healed. Cycle time is sped up or slowed down by the multipliers section.
# Setting type: Single
# Default value: 3
# Acceptable value range: From 0,1 to 300
Cycle Duration = 5

## Time in seconds where regeneration is blocked upon taking damage. I recommend keeping this above 0 so you don't instantly regenerate health upon being damaged.
# Setting type: Single
# Default value: 5
# Acceptable value range: From 0,1 to 300
Damage Cooldown = 7

## How much health you can regenerate in a day before regeneration is blocked off for the rest of the day. Set to 0 for no limit.
# Setting type: Int32
# Default value: 0
# Acceptable value range: From 0 to 1000
Limit Per Day = 0

## Maximum health you are allowed to regenerate up to.
# Setting type: Int32
# Default value: 100
# Acceptable value range: From 20 to 100
Maximum Health = 80

## Check the player's health at the start of each game to determine the max health. If this value is higher than the one set in Maximum Health, then this will be used as the regeneration limit instead. Useful with mods that allow the player to go above 100 HP.
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: true
Auto Determine Max Health = true

## If regeneration should be paused while the player is below 20 HP, allowing the vanilla regeneration to take over. If disabled, both the vanilla regeneration and the mod's regeneration will be active below 20 HP.
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: true
Disable During Critical Injury = true
