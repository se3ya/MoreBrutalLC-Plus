[Cruiser+]

## [Magnet rotation]
## fixes the cruiser rotation when magneted to only be 90 or 270 (parallel to the ship). otherwise at certain angles (~225 or 315-360) it can be magneted to 180 or 360 and be partially inside the ship.
## host must have this enabled for it to apply. all clients will see the fixed rotation if host has this enabled
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: true
magnet_rotation = true

## [Move items]
## move items from the cruiser to the ship when going into orbit. the items are only moved if they were collected (like with the magnet).
## this is client sided so items are only shown to have been moved to players with this enabled.
## if one player has this enabled and another player has this disabled (or doesn't have this mod), the item positions will be different, however picking up the item/s will resync the position.
## in vanilla any collected items in the cruiser will be moved to the ship when leaving and rejoining after the game saved, so this feature is the same as vanilla except without having to leave and rejoin.
## 1 = disabled
## 2 = only enabled when you're host, or if the host has this enabled
## 3 = always enabled
# Setting type: Int32
# Default value: 2
move_items = 2

## [Only move scrap items]
## only moves scrap and leaves other items in the cruiser.
## if the host has this mod this will be set to what the host has this set to
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: true
only_scrap = false

## [Mute engine audio]
## mute engine audio while in orbit
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: true
mute_engine = false

## [Mute radio audio]
## mute radio audio while in orbit
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: true
mute_radio = false

## [Storage light]
## adds a light to the storage area of the cruiser
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: true
light = false

## [Storage light switch]
## adds a button in the storage area of the cruiser for turning on/off the storage light.
## turning the light on/off is synced with other players if the host has this mod
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: true
light_switch = false

## [Scrap items]
## whether cruiser scrap items should be enabled or disabled.
## items are a percentage based retexture of v-type engine, and are synced with other players if the synced percentages config is enabled
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: true
scrap = false

## [Cruiser item percentage]
## percentage that the cruiser item will replace v-type engine.
## input = percentage, 40 is 40%
# Setting type: Int32
# Default value: 40
cruiser_percentage = 0

## [Cruiser alt item percentage]
## percentage that the cruiser item will be an alternate version.
## input = percentage, 40 is 40%
# Setting type: Int32
# Default value: 40
cruiser_alt_percentage = 0

## [Cruiser item interaction]
## adds interacting with the cruiser items by clicking while holding them to play an event.
## events are a mix of audio and visual effects, there are about 49 events, some events have follow-up effects that are related to or continue the previous effect.
## host must have this config and the scrap config enabled for the events to be synced between players. if host has either config disabled or doesn't have this mod then the events will play locally instead
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: true
cruiser_item_interaction = false

## [Save/load seeds]
## whether the engine/cruiser item types should be saved to the save file. this saves the seed that determines the items type, so it will be the same when rejoining.
## loading a save file that has saved seeds without having the scrap config enabled or without having this enabled or while in lan isn't recommended as the saved seeds can be reset if the number of items is changed.
## saved item types are synced with other players if the synced percentages config is enabled.
## scrap config must be enabled for this to be enabled
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: true
save/load = false

## [Client wait_timer]
## when joining a lobby as non-host engine items will wait to set their item type until the network message sent by the host has been received or the time spent waiting reached the maximum amount set by this config.
## there will be a log message specifying if the network message was received first or the timer ended first. if the timer is often ending before the message from the host is being received then this should be increased.
## min is 20, max is 4000. 100 is before the player spawn animation ends, 500 is about 10 seconds, 1000 is about 15 seconds
# Setting type: Int32
# Default value: 100
timer = 100

## [Synced percentages]
## automatically sync config cruiser item percentages with the host. only disable if you're aware that disabling this can cause the cruiser item types to not be the same as other players if playing with others that have this mod
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: true
sync = false

## [Speedometer]
## adds a speedometer
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: true
speedometer = true

## [Cruiser position/rotation after joining]
## when joining a lobby with a cruiser, it will be on the magnet instead of on the opposite side of the ship.
## also fixes the 'rotation quaternions must be unit length' error from the cruiser after joining
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: true
fix = true

## [QueryTriggerInteraction]
## changes the Physics.OverlapSphere QueryTriggerInteraction in VehicleController.CollectItemsInTruck from Ignore to Collide.
## attempts to fix some modded items (and teeth) not being collected by the magnet and not having isInShipRoom set to true, so the move items script would skip them
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: true
collide = false

## [Cruiser 1up]
## allows purchasing another cruiser in the same day if the current cruiser is destroyed
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: false
1up = false

## [Magnet lever]
## adds a lever to the cruiser for turning on/off the ship magnet
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: true
lever = false

## [Headlights]
## whether the headlights are on or off when the cruiser is spawned.
## 1 = headlights on, headlights material off (same as vanilla)
## 2 = headlights on, headlights material on
## 3 = headlights off, headlights material off
# Setting type: Int32
# Default value: 2
headlights = 2

## [Disable input while typing]
## whether driving the cruiser (wasd/space) is disabled while typing in chat
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: false
disable_input = false

## [Separate jump/boost keybinds]
## makes the boost keybind [Space] plus [config value]. setting to None (or an invalid key) will disable this config and be the same as vanilla. for example if set to LeftShift will make the boost keybind Space+LeftShift, so only pressing Space will jump the cruiser instead.
